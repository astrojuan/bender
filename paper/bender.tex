\begin{abstract}
Fully relativistic framework of formulae is derived for emission originating from around compact rotating objects.
We specialize the formulae for rotating oblate neutron stars and describe the surrounding metric up to second order in rotation.
The entire framework is derived in a fully general relativistic manner, and as such we also validate previous ad-hod special relativistic formulations during the derivation.
We give a detailed descriptions of the numerical algorithms used and provide an open source implementation of the framework freely available from \textsc{http://github.com/natj/bender}.
As an application, we calculate accurate pulse profiles from hot spots on top of rapidly rotating accreting millisecond pulsars.

\section{Introduction}
Accurately modelling the emission from and around a compact objects is a complicated combination of radiative processes and relativity.
Not only is the object bending the spacetime around it, and hence affecting the trajectory of photons, but also affecting the apparent observed radiation because the emitting surface can move with relativistic velocities.
Applications for such accurate analysis of the radiation range from numerous black hole disk emission studies to neutron star pulse profile analysis.
Emission around rotating (Kerr) black holes has been conviniently formulated and implemented in the publicly available \textsc{geokerr} and \textsc{grtrans} codes \citep{dexter2009, dexter2016}.
Here we focus on the emission from neutron stars. 

When compared to black holes, a further complication with neutron stars is that the emission is not only originating from the viscinity of the object but from the surface of the star itself that is rapidly rotating.
This introduces additional complications to the radiative tranfer problem as we have general relativistic effect like bending of photon trajectories in addition to special relativistic effects like Doppler boosting and abberration of the observed angles.
Combining all of these effects is both theoretically and numerically a challenging task.
Current and future observations, on the other hand, demand a high accuracy from the modelled radiation.
Hence, computing e.g. accurate pulse profiles from hot spots on top of spinning neutron stars has been under a lot of scrutinity recently, because of many upcoming or planned new spaceborne observatories like ESA's \textit{XIPE} or NASA's \textit{NICER} X-ray missions.
The upside is, that with accurate pulse profile observations there is a lot of hope of constraining, for example, the still unknown equation of state (EoS) of the dense matter inside neutron stars from the information encoded to the radiation.

Here we focus mainly on the X-ray emission from accreting millisecond pulsars (AMPs).
We, however, stress that the whole framework presented in this paper is general enough to be applied to any form of radiation originating from the visicinity of rotating compact objects. 
The radiation here emerges from hot spots on top of a rapidly rotating neutron star as the infalling accreted material is being channeled to the magnetic poles heating soem patch of the star's surface
The magnetical axis does not need to coincide with the rotational axis of the star and hence pulsations can be observed from the spots that are rotating around the star.
Accretion can also spin up these objects into extreme rotational velocities: spin frequencies up to 620 Hz have been verified (4U 1608$-$52; \red{ref Muno}) whereas even a typical source usually has a period somewhere around 400 Hz.
This can complicate the modelling of radiation further as the emitting surface itself can become oblate \red{ref AlGendy Morsink, Cook 1994}.
Not only does this oblate surface then complicate the radiating surface but also breaks the spherical symmetry of the surrounding spacetime as tidal forces are being introduces to the metric.

The spacetime metric around a static non-rotating spherically symmetric object is given by the well known \sch solution
\begin{align}\begin{split}
ds^2 & = -(1-u)dt^2 + \\
     & (1-u)^{-1}dr^2+r^2(d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2)
\end{split}\end{align}
where $u = 2GM/c^2 r$ is the dimensionless compactness factor and $r$ is the radial coordinate, defined so that an area of a sphere in this coordinate system is the usual $4\pi r^2$ at some fixed time.
This is equivalent to an alternative solution known as isotropic \sch metric \citep[see e.g.][]{MTW73}
\begin{align}\begin{split}
\label{eq:ISch}
ds^2 & = -\left( \frac{1-\frac{\ub}{2}}{1+\frac{\ub}{2}} \right)^2 dt^2 + \\
     & (1+\frac{\ub}{2})^4(d\rb^2 + \rb^2(d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2)),
\end{split}\end{align}
where  $\rb$ and $\ub=GM/c^2\rb$ are the so-called isotropic radial
coordinate and the corresponding isotropic compactness factor,
respectively. 
This kind of isotropic metric has the useful feature that surfaces of constant time are conformally flat, and hence the angles are represented without distortion.
This, however, also means that angular isotropic coordinates do not faithfully represent the distances within the spheres nor does the radial coordinate correspond directly to the radial distance.
From here on, we mark all variables related to the isotropic radial coordinate with a bar on top.

Let us consider a rotating compact object.
In addition to the dimensionless compactness factor $u(r)$ (or $\ub(\rb)$), to describe our system we need a dimensionless angular velocity
\be
\Ob = \Omega \left( \frac{\Req^3}{G M} \right)^{1/2},
\ee
where $\Omega$ is the angular velocity of a sphere with an equatorial radius $\Req$ and a mass $M$ scaled with a Newtonian mass shedding (Kepler) limit $(GM/\Req^3)^{1/2}$ \citep[see][p.29]{rcs}.  
Here $\Req$ is described using the usual \sch radial coordinate and corresponds to the equatorial radius of the star for which $2\pi\Req$ gives the proper length of the circumference.  
The asymptotically flat metric near a stationary axisymmetric rotating object in isotropic form is \citep{BW71} 
\begin{align}\begin{split} \label{eq:BWmetric}
ds^2 & = -e^{2\nub}c^2dt^2 +
     \rb^2 \sin^2\theta \Bb^2 e^{-2\nub}(d\phi - \wb cdt)^2 + \\
     & e^{2(\zetab-\nub)}(d\rb^2 + \rb^2d\theta^2),
\end{split}\end{align}
%\eea
where $\wb$ is the angular velocity of the local inertial frame and the functions $\nub$, $\Bb$ and $\zetab$ in the metric coefficients can be expanded in the powers of $\Ob$ and $\ub$ \citep{BI76}.
%\red{rcs:14}
%\red{rcs:15}
Here $e^{-\nub}$ is the time dilation factor relating the proper time of the local observer to the time at infinity.
Physical interpretation of $\Bb$ follows from the fact that the proper circumference of a circle around the axis of symmetry is $2\pi(e^{-\nub} \Bb \rb \sin\theta)$.
Similarly, the interpretation of $\zetab$ follows from the fact that $e^{\zetab - \nub}$ acts as a conformal (angle preserving) factor of the spacetime. %determining the orthogonality of the 2-surfaces.
The zeroth terms of the series expansions ($\Ob = 0$) are the familiar isotropic \sch metric coefficients (see Table \ref{tab:coeffs}).
%\be
%e^{\nu_0} = (1-\ub/2)/(1+\ub/2),
%\ee
%\be 
%\Bb_0 = (1-\ub/2)(1+\ub/2)
%\ee
%and
%\be
%\zetab_0 = \log \Bb_0.
%\ee

The first order expansion in rotation ($\Ob^1$) is formally related to Kerr metric.
In this case we introduce an angular velocity term of the local inertial frame $\wb$ that accounts for the frame-dragging effects. %\red{rcs:13}
Up to first order, this can be defined as
\be
\wb = \frac{2c^4j}{G^2M}\ub^3,
\ee
where the dimensionless quantity $j=\mathcal{J}/M^2$ and $\mathcal{J} = I \Omega$ is the star's angular momentum with moment of inertia $I(M,\Omega)$.

Finally, the second order expansion ($\Ob^2$) correspond to a similar approximation as the Hartle-Throne slow-rotation spacetime, which introduces quadrupole moments into the metric.  
These second order multipole moments can be defined via dimensionless quantities $q$ and $\beta$ that are the dimensionless moments of energy density and pressure.  
\citet{aGM14} defined an approximate relation for these parameters based on their computations of rotating NSs with various different EoSs.  
Due to the NS spacetime being almost hairless we can parameterize these quantities with great accuracy by using only the dimensionless angular velocity $\Ob$ and compactness factor
\be
x = \frac{G M}{c^2 \Req}.
\ee
Note that both of these parameters are defined via the equatorial circumferential radius $\Req$ defined in the usual \sch radial coordinate system.
To the lowest order, these approximations are
\be\label{eq:quad}
q = -0.11 \frac{\Ob^2}{x^2},
\ee
\be\label{eq:beta}
\beta = 0.4454 \Ob^2 x,
\ee
and
\be
I = \sqrt{x} (1.136 - 2.53 x + 5.6 x^2) M \Req^2.
\ee
Note also that both $q$ and $\beta$ are $\mathcal{O}(\Ob^2)$, while $I$ is $\mathcal{O}(\Ob)$.
    
It is possible to transform between the usual $r$ and the isotropic $\rb$ coordinates using the relation \citep{FIP86}
\be\label{eq:rb2r}
r = \Bb e^{-\nub} \rb.
\ee
The relation between the two infinitesimal radial coordinates turns out to be
\be\label{eq:drb2dr}
dr = e^{\zetab} d\rb
\ee
which can be computed using the series presentation of \cite{BI76}.

Since the series expansions of the metric coefficients are expanded using the isotropic radial coordinate $\rb$, we will favor this notation in our derivation.  
However, in some cases we will simplify the equations into more intuitive form by using the areal $r$ coordinate.


\subsection{Oblate shape of the neutron star}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=7cm]{figs/fig1.eps}
\caption{\label{fig:geom}

}
\end{figure}

Due to rotation and finite pressure supporting it, the neutron star is not a perfect sphere when it is rotating.  
It, however, retains axisymmetry, and can be approximated with an oblate spheroid.  
Similarly to the second order space-time quantities, \citet{aGM14} derived an approximate shape of a rotating neutron star by expressing the radius as a function of colatitude $\theta$, yielding
\begin{align}\begin{split}\label{eq:radf}
    R(\theta) &= \Req \left( 1 - \frac{\Req - R_{\mathrm{p}}}{\Req} \cos^2\theta \right) \\
              &= \Req (1-\Ob^2 (0.788 - 1.03x) \cos^2 \theta,
\end{split}\end{align}
where $R_{\mathrm{p}}$ is the radius on the rotational axis and $R(\pi/2) = \Req$ is the equatorial circumferential radius measured in the usual \sch metric. 
Elemental surface area for a spheroid is given as (using the areal radial coordinates)
\be
dS(\theta) = R^2(\theta) \sin\theta \sqrt{1 + f(\theta)^2}d\theta d\phi,
\ee
where
\be
f(\theta) = \frac{1}{\bar{R}(\theta)} \frac{d \bar{R}(\theta)}{d \theta} 
= \Bb e^{-\zetab-\nub} \frac{1}{R(\theta)} \frac{dR(\theta)}{d\theta}, 
\ee
and $\Bb e^{-\zetab-\nub} \approx \left(1-\frac{2 G M}{c^2 r}\right)^{-1/2} + \mathcal{O}(\Ob^2)$.
The angle $\gamma$, defined as the angle between the radial unit vector $\vec{r}$ and the surface normal $\vec{n}$, is given by
\be
\cos\gamma = \left(1 + f(\theta)^2\right)^{-1/2}.
\ee
Then the normal to the surface can be defined using the radial vector $\vec{r}$ and the tangential vector $\vec{\theta}$ as
\be
\vec{n} = \cos\gamma \vec{r} + \sin\gamma \vec{\theta}.
\ee
See also Fig.~\ref{fig:geom} for a clarification of the angles.
From here it is again clear how the angles transform easily in the isotropic metric while the quantities related to the area are simplified in the usual \sch metric.

\subsection{Geodesic motion through Hamilton-Jacobi equation}
Geodesic motion in space-time characterized by a metric $g_{ij}$ is governed by Hamilton-Jacobi equation
\be\label{eq:hamjac}
2\frac{\pd S}{\pd \tau} = g^{ij} \frac{\pd S}{\pd x^i}\frac{\pd S}{\pd x^j},
\ee
where $g^{ij}$ is the inverse metric and $S$ denotes the Hamilton's principal function.
For the two Killing vectors $t^{\alpha} = (1,0,0,0)$ (asymptotic time symmetry) and $\phi^{\alpha} = (0,0,0,1)$ (rotation symmetry along azimuthal angles) in the rotating space-time, the Frobenius theorem implies the existence of a family of 2-surfaces orthogonal to these vectors \citep[see e.g][p.12]{rcs}.  
This means that there are surfaces of constant $t$ and $\phi$ in our spacetime, yielding two constants of motion, energy $E$ and the $z$-component of the angular momentum, $L_z$.  
We then seek a solution of equation~\eqref{eq:hamjac} in the form
\be
S = \frac{1}{2}\delta_1 \tau - Et + L_z\phi + S_{\rb}(\rb) + S_{\theta}(\theta).
\ee
With the metric function \eqref{eq:BWmetric} this becomes
\begin{align}\begin{split} 
    \delta_1 \rb^2 \Bb^2 e^{-2\nub} =~& \rb^2 \Bb^2 e^{-2\zetab} \pd_{\rb}S_{\rb}S^2 - e^{-4\nub} \Bb^2 \rb^2 (E - L_z \wb)^2 \\
                                & + \Bb^2 e^{-2\zetab} \pd_{\theta}S_{\theta}^2 + \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2\theta}.
\end{split}\end{align}
After re-organizing terms and introducing a simplifying notation $e^{\zetab}/\Bb \equiv e^{\mub}$ we get
\begin{align}\begin{split}\label{eq:S}
& e^{-2\mub}\pd_{\theta}S_{\theta}^2 + \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2\theta} = \\ 
& \Bb^2 e^{-2\nub}\rb^2 ( e^{2(\nub-\zetab)} \pd_{\rb}S_{\rb}^2 -\delta_{1} - e^{-2\nub}(E - L_z \wb)^2,
\end{split}\end{align}
that already hints towards separability only if $\nub = \nub(\rb)$, $\Bb = \Bb(\rb)$, $\zetab = \zetab(\rb)$ and $\mu = \mu(\theta)$.

To first order in rotation, i.e. $\mathcal{O}(\Ob)$, this condition is satisfied exactly because $e^{\mub} = 1 + \mathcal{O}(\Ob^2)$, in addition to $\nub = \nub_0(\rb) + \mathcal{O}(\Ob^2)$ and $\Bb = \Bb_0(\rb) + \mathcal{O}(\Ob^2)$ (see Table \ref{tab:coeffs}).  
In the second order of the expansion, $\theta$ dependent mass and pressure quadrupole moments are present, and separability is lost.
For geodesics, however, these higher order deviations only contribute very close to the actual NS surface, and neglecting them enables us to obtain accurate approximations of the photon path.
Since we only consider null geodesics, we could set $\delta_1 = 0$ at this point, but for reasons of generality, this substitution is not made.

If we now assume separability, we can introduce a separation variable $\Ca$ known as Carter's constant (third constant of motion) in order to solve the differential equation \eqref{eq:S}.  
By noting that the conjugate momenta correspond to the first derivatives of $S$ with respect to the generalized coordinates, we can write the components of four-momentum, \fvec{p}, as 
\begin{align}
  p_t        &= -E \label{eq:p_t}\\
  p_{\rb}    &= \pm e^{\zetab - 2\nub} \left( \delta_1 e^{2\nub} + (E - L_z \wb)^2 - \frac{\Ca}{\Bb^2 e^{-4\nub} \rb^2} \right)^{1/2}\label{eq:p_r}\\
  p_{\theta} &= \pm e^{\mub} \left( \Ca - \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2\theta} \right)^{1/2}\label{eq:p_the}\\
  p_{\phi}   &= L_z\label{eq:p_p}.
\end{align}
Similarly, the components of a local tetrad frame are
\begin{align}
  p^{(t)} &= -p_{(t)} = -e_{(t)}^{\hat{\mu}} p_{\hat{\mu}} = -e^{-\nub}p_t \label{eq:tetp_t}\\
  p^{(\rb)} &= p_{(\rb)} = e_{(\rb)}^{\hat{\mu}} p_{\hat{\mu}} = e^{-\zetab + \nub} p_{\rb} \label{eq:tetp_r}\\
  p^{(\theta)} &= p_{(\theta)} = e_{(\theta)}^{\hat{\mu}} p_{\hat{\mu}} = \frac{1}{\rb} e^{-\zetab+\nub} p_{\theta} \label{eq:tetp_theta}\\
  %p^{(\phi)} &= p_{(\phi)} = e_{(\phi)}^{\hat{\mu}} p_{\hat{\mu}} = -e^{-\nub} \wb p_t + \frac{1}{r \sin\theta} p_{\phi} \label{eq:tetp_phi},
  p^{(\phi)} &= p_{(\phi)} = e_{(\phi)}^{\hat{\mu}} p_{\hat{\mu}} = \frac{1}{e^{-\nub} \Bb \rb \sin\theta} p_{\phi} \label{eq:tetp_phi},
\end{align}
where $e^{\hat{\mu}}_{(a)}$ with index $a = t, \rb, \theta$ and $\phi$ are the tetrads of metric \eqref{eq:BWmetric}.


\subsection{Ray tracing photons}
Radiation is emitted from the surface of a star at an emission point $(r_e,\theta_e,\phi_e)$.  
The radiation travels along a geodesic with a specific intensity $I_{E}$ as measured by an observer co-moving with the emission point.  
The radiation is observed at an image plane situated at a radial distance $r$, with $r\rightarrow\infty$.  
We then wish to calculate the projected image of the star at this image plane.

First we set up the coordinate system so that the plane of observation is towards $\phi = 0$ and $\theta = i$, where $i$ is the angle of inclination.  
The geodesic will be emitted with a four-momentum $\fvec{p}_e$, and if it is eventually observed at the image plane at infinity, it will have a final four-momentum of $(E,\hat{p}_r,0,0)$, purely in the radial direction.  
Likewise, the components of the position must satisfy
\begin{align}
\theta &\rightarrow i \\
\phi   &\rightarrow 0,
\end{align}
as $r\rightarrow\infty$.
The change in the time and angular components along the geodesic can be written as
\begin{align}
dt      &= \frac{p^t}{p^{\rb}}\ud \rb \label{eq:deltatime} \\
d\theta &= \frac{p^\theta}{p^{\rb}}\ud \rb \label{eq:deltatheta} \\
d\phi   &= \frac{p^\phi}{p^{\rb}}\ud \rb \label{eq:deltaphi},
%d\theta &= \int_{r_e}^\infty \frac{p^\theta}{p^r}\ud r \label{eq:deltatheta} \\
%d\phi   &= \int_{r_e}^\infty \frac{p^\phi}{p^r}\ud r \label{eq:deltaphi},
\end{align}
with a total change of angles $\Delta\theta$ and $\Delta\phi$ when integrating from $r_e$ to $\infty$.
The condition for being observed is then
\begin{align}
\theta_e + \Delta\theta &= i \label{eq:thetacond}\\
\phi_e + \Delta\phi     &= 0 \label{eq:phicond}.
\end{align}

The projected image of the star on the image plane can then be described by two celestial coordinates:
abscissa $\hat{x}$ and ordinate $\hat{y}$.
Making use of the tetrad components \eqref{eq:tetp_t}--\eqref{eq:tetp_phi}, we obtain \citep[][p.347]{cha}
\be\label{eq:xhat}
\hat{x} = \left( \frac{rp^{(\phi)}}{p^{(t)}} \right)_{r \rightarrow \infty} = \frac{1}{\sin i} \frac{L_z}{E}
\ee
and
\be\label{eq:yhat}
\hat{y} = \left( \frac{rp^{(\theta)}}{p^{(t)}} \right)_{r \rightarrow \infty} = \frac{\sqrt{\Ca - \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2 i}}}{E}.
\ee
Here it is useful to transform into a polar coordinate system on the image plane, as the form of the equations \eqref{eq:xhat} and \eqref{eq:yhat} strongly suggest a more intuitive form if this is done. 
In this system we use as coordinates the radial distance from the center point, or the impact parameter $b$, and the polar rotation angle $\chi$.  
We take $\chi$ to increase clockwise from the projected spin axis of the neutron star, with $\chi=0$ corresponding to the projected direction from the south to the north pole of the neutron star.  
We then express the impact parameter $b$ and the angle $\chi$ via $L_z$ and $\Ca$ as%
\footnote{
    Here, the nature of Carter's constant as a generalized squared
    angular momentum is apparent.
}
\be
b = \frac{\sqrt{\Ca}}{E}
\ee
and
\be
\sin \chi = \frac{1}{\sin i} \frac{L_z}{\sqrt{\Ca}}.
\ee
The constants of motion, combined with the geodesic null condition $p^\mu p_\mu = 0$, allow us to solve $p^\theta$ and $p^\phi$ in terms of $\rb$.
As the final step we can substitute the four-momentum components and image-plane coordinates into \eqref{eq:deltatime}--\eqref{eq:deltaphi} and solve the system of three first-order differential equations (in terms of $t$, $\theta$ and $\phi$) with $\rb$ as a variable.


\subsection{Redshift and emission angle}
It is most convenient to define all radiative processes in the co-rotating frame of the star.
We denote variables defined in a frame that is momentarily comoving with the stellar surface with a prime.  
On the other hand, our observer is stationary and moving along the timelike Killing vector.  
Hence, we need to transform between stationary and rotating frames by using the 4-velocity of the star's fluid.  
In addition, we need to take into account that a particle released from infinity with zero angular momentum will acquire nonzero angular velocity in direction of the star's rotation due to dragging of inertial frames.
Four-velocity of a stationary observer is then $o^{\alpha} = o^t(t^{\alpha})$, where the normalization factor $o^t = e^{-\nub}(1-\vw^2)^{-1/2}$ is obtained from $o_{\alpha}o^{\alpha} = -1$, and the velocity of the frame is 
\be
\vw = \wb \Bb e^{-2\nub} \rb \sin\theta,
\ee
indicating that the angular velocity as measured by an inertial observer at infinity is $o^{\phi} / o^{t} = d\phi/dt = \wb$.

A circular flow can be defined using the timelike and rotational Killing vectors as $s^{\alpha} = s^t (t^{\alpha} + \Omega \phi^{\alpha})$, where the normalization factor is defined as $s^t = e^{-\nub} (1 - \vz^2)^{-1/2}$ determined by $s_{\alpha}s^{\alpha} = -1$.
Here the velocity 
\be
\vz = (\Omega - \wb) \Bb e^{-2\nub} \rb \sin\theta,
\ee
can be identified to be the 3-velocity measured in the frame of a zero angular momentum observer, an observer rotating along the frame with a velocity of $\vw$.

The total redshift as measured by an observed at infinity is then given by an inner-product between a photon $u^{\alpha}$ and a 4-velocity of the star's fluid $s^{\alpha}$.
With these definitions the redshift is
\be
1 + z = -s_{\alpha} u^{\alpha} = e^{-\nub} ~\delta^{-1},
\ee
consisting of the gravitational part $e^{\nub}$ and of the second Doppler-like term
\be
\delta = \frac{\sqrt{1-\vz^2}}{1 - \Omega L_Z}.
\ee

To compute the emission angle we again have to take the rotating frame into account.  
This can be done by introducing a projection operator $\bar{h}_{ab} = g_{ab} + s_a s_b$, which projects 4-vectors from the non-rotating frame to the rotating frame where the radiative processes are defined.  
As a definition, we can take the emission angle to be the angle between photon and a spacelike surface normal vector $n_{\alpha} = (0, \cos\gamma/N_n, \rb \sin\gamma/N_n, 0)$, with normalization $N_n = e^{\zetab - \nub}$ fullfilling $n_{\alpha}n^{\alpha} = -1$.  
When projected to the rotating-frame we can then obtain the angle from the generalized dot-product definition between two vectors as
\be\label{eq:gen_angle}
\cos\alpha' = \frac{\bar{h}_{ab}n^a u^b}{(\bar{h}_{ab} n^a n^a)^{1/2} (\bar{h}_{ab} u^a u^b)^{1/2}}.
\ee
Using the metric defined by \eqref{eq:BWmetric} and a photon with components as \eqref{eq:p_t}$-$\eqref{eq:p_p}, we obtain
\be
\cos\alpha' = \delta e^{2\nub-\zetab} \left[ p_{\rb} \cos\gamma + \frac{p_{\theta} \sin\gamma}{\rb} \right].
\ee
Here it suffices to notice that we are only interested in the emission angle value at the surface of the star i.e. $\rb = \bar{R}(\theta)$.

The result here is similar to the emission angle obtained with a special-relativistic approach, using flat-space trigonometry and Lorentz-boosting to the rotating frame \citep[see e.g.][]{PB06}.


\subsection{Emission}
Observed flux at photon energy $E$ from a small area on an image plane is
\be
dF_E = I_E d\Omega_o,
\ee
where $I_E$ is the specific intensity of the radiation at infinity and $d\Omega_o$ is the solid angle subtended by the element as measured by the observer. 
The total flux is then the integral of these elements over the image plane. 
As a final step this observed flux hast to be connected to the actual emerging radiation.

The relation between the emergent energy $E'$ to the observed energy $E$ is $E/E' = (1 + z)^{-1}$.
The connection between the monochromatic observed and local intensity is then (see e.g. \citealt{MTW73}, p.588; \citealt{RL79}, p.145)
\be
I_E = \left( \frac{E}{E'} \right)^3 ~I'_{E'}(\alpha'),
\ee
where $I'_{E'}(\alpha')$ is the intensity computed in the frame comoving with the emitting area.
The radiation here is emitted to the direction of the emission angle $\alpha'$ defined in the local rotating frame.
Integrating over the energies, we get the bolometric intensity
\be
I = \left(\frac{E}{E'} \right)^4 ~I'(\alpha').
\ee
The total (monochromatic) flux as a function of observer's time $F_E(t)$ can then be obtained by integrating over the whole image
\be\label{eq:fluxint}
F_E(t) = \int I_{E}(t) ~d\Omega_o = \int\int \frac{I'_{E'}(t_*, \alpha')}{(1+z)^3}  ~bdb \, d\chi,
\ee
where $t_* = t - \Delta t$ is the time when the photon was originally emitted. 
This can be computed when we know the total travel time $\Delta t$ against some reference photon, for example the one with the shortest path to the observer.

All of these quantities on the star's spherical coordinate system $(\theta, \phi)$ are then mapped to the observers polar image coordinates $(b, \chi)$ via raytracing.
Note that the original longitudinal coordinate of the emission is easily obtained from $\phi_e = \phi - t_* \Omega$, because both $t_*$ and $\Omega$ are defined for a distant observer and change in the azimuthal coordinate is Lorentz invariant.
%This mapping $(b, \chi) \rightarrow (\theta, \phi)$ allows us to then evaluate the physical quantities
%\begin{align}
%1+z                  &\rightarrow 1+z(\theta, \phi) \rightarrow 1+z(b, \chi), \\
%\cos\alpha'          &\rightarrow \cos\alpha'(\theta, \phi) \rightarrow \cos\alpha'(b, \chi), \\
%\Delta t             &\rightarrow \Delta t(\theta, \phi) \rightarrow \Delta t(b, \chi), \\
%I'_{E'}(t_*, \alpha') &\rightarrow I'_{E'}(t_*, \cos\alpha'; \theta, \phi) \rightarrow I'_{E'}(t_*, \cos\alpha'; b, \chi)
%\end{align}
%in the observers plane for the flux calculations.


\subsection{Coordinates in the co-rotating frame}
If the emission originates from the surface of a neutron star then all of the radiative processes are defined in the local co-rotating frame of the star.
Because of this, it is natural to define the shape of the emitting region using the coordinate system of the co-rotating observer.  
In practice, this then gives us the integration limits of equation \eqref{eq:fluxint}.

Transformation from the non-rotating frame to the rotating frame can be obtained using a projection operator $\bar{h}_{ab}$ defined previously.
%\be
%\bar{h}_{ab}Â = g_{ab} + s_a s_b
%\ee
%where $s_a$ is the 4-velocity of the previously defined star's fluid element.
Our metric tensor for the rotating observer is then
\be
\bar{h}_{ab} dx^a dx^b = e^{2(\zetab - \nub)} (d\rb^2 + \rb^2 d\theta) + \frac{\Bb^2 e^{-2\nub} \rb^2 \sin^2\theta}{1-v_Z^2} d\phi_*^2,
\ee
where we have defined a new angular coordinate $\phi_* = \phi - \Omega t$ that is used by the rotating observer.%
\footnote{We thank S. Morsink for pointing this out. 
The normalized longitudinal coordinate ensures that both, rotating and stationary observer, agree that a circle drawn around the star has $2\pi$ radians.}
This new longitudinal coordinate is also seen to be Lorentz contracted by $\gamma_\mathrm{L} = (1-\vz^2)^{-1/2}$ factor.

Next we move to a normal (areal) \sch coordinate system so that emission regions with similar coordinate extents at different latitudes have the same area.
By using the equations \eqref{eq:rb2r} and \eqref{eq:drb2dr} we obtain a longitudinally Lorentz-boosted metric tensor 
\be \label{eq:gammaSch} 
h_{ab} dx^a dx^b = e^{-2\nub}dr^2 + \frac{e^{2\zetab}}{\Bb^2} r^2 d\theta + \lgamma^2 r^2 \sin^2\theta d\phi_*^2, 
\ee 
where $\gamma_\text{L}$ is the Lorentz boost factor.
The result agrees with (areal) \sch coordinate system up to first order in rotation due to the fact that $e^{\zetab}/\Bb \approx 1 + \mathcal{O}(\Omega^2)$.  
Additionally we can drop the gravitational redshift term $e^{-2\nub}$ of the radial coordinate as we are only considering unit vectors later on.

In order to define shapes on the surface via angular distance from a point at given latitude $\theta_{\mathrm{S}}$ we next define a radial vector in (3D) Cartesian coordinate system as 
\be
\vec{r} = (x_r, y_r, z_r) = r (\cos\phi_* \sin\theta, \sin\phi_* \sin\theta, \cos\theta).
\ee
%where normalization factor $\hat{R} = \sqrt{x_r^2 + y_r^2 + z_r^2}$.

By using a Jacobian $\partial(x_r, y_r, z_r)/\partial (r, \theta, \phi_*)$ we can transform the metric \eqref{eq:gammaSch} into a Cartesian coordinate basis, and by setting $\phi_*=0$ we define our frame with $y$-axis along the direction of the motion, $x$-axis along the meridian towards the equator, and $z$ axis along the radial direction.
Hence, the co-rotating observer has a Cartesian metric
\begin{align}\begin{split}
%&\hat{g}_{ij} dx^i dx^j &= \frac{\partial(r, \theta, \phi_*)}{\partial{(x, y, z)} h_{ab} dx^a dx^b  \\
& \hat{g}_{ij} d\hat{x}^i d\hat{x}^j = \frac{\partial x^a \partial x^b}{\partial \hat{x}^i \partial \hat{x}^j} h_{ab} dx^a dx^b  \\
&= \gamma_L^2 dy^2 + \frac{1}{2} [ (1+ \frac{e^{2\zetab}}{\Bb^2})(dx^2 + dz^2) \\
&+ (\frac{e^{2\zetab}}{\Bb^2} - 1)(dx-dz)(dx + dz) \cos(2\theta) - 2dx dz \sin(2\theta) ] \\
& = dx^2 + \gamma_L^2 dy^2 + dz^2 + \mathcal{O}(\Omega^2)
\end{split}\end{align}
From here it is then easy to obtain the great circle distance (on a unit sphere) as measured by the co-rotating observer by using the generalized inner-product \eqref{eq:gen_angle} to get an angle
\be\label{eq:rel_cos}
\cos\rho = \frac{\cos\theta \cos\theta_\mathrm{S} + \cos\phi \sin\theta \sin\theta_{\mathrm{S}}}{\sqrt{ \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta (\cos\phi^2 + \lgamma^2 \sin\phi^2)}} + \mathcal{O}(\Omega^2), 
\ee
between points at $(\theta, \phi)$ and $(\theta_{\mathrm{S}}, 0)$.
This angle definition of $\rho$ is then a distance as measured on top of a co-rotating unit sphere.  
It is also possible to generalize the aforementioned angle for oblate surfaces by considering a projection operator $\hat{h}_{ab} = g_{ab} + s_a s_b - n_a n_b$ with an additional projection against $n_a$ that is the previously defined normal to the (oblate) surface.

We also note that the area element of the co-rotating observer can be obtained from
\begin{align}\begin{split}
dS' &= \sqrt{\det h_{ab}} d\theta d\phi_* \\
&= \frac{e^{\zetab}}{B} \lgamma r^2 \sin\theta d\theta d\phi_* = \lgamma dS + \mathcal{O}(\Ob^2). \\
\end{split}\end{align}
Hence, if we define our coordinates in the static frame and then integrate over some shape on top of the surface using these coordinates, our flux would differ by a factor of $\lgamma$.

%In order to compare our calculations to previous \sch 
%In addition, one needs to take into account the transformation of the solid angle $\Omega_0 = dS'\cos/\sigma$ with area element $dS$ and the corresponding observer angle $\cos\sigma$, that are defined in the non-rotating frame.
%Transformation of this element from the non-rotating to rotating frame can be obtained using a projection operator of a co-rotating observer\footnote{We thank S. Morsink for pointing this out}
%\be
%h_{ab}Â = g_{ab} + s_a s_b - n_a n_b,
%\ee
%where $s_a$ is the 4-velocity of the previously defined star's fluid element and $w_a$ is again the 4-velocity orthogonal to the oblate surface. 
%Using this operator perpendicular to the star's surface, we can then define the area element as $dS' = \sqrt{\det{h_{ab}}} dx^1 dx^2$ with surface coordinates $x^1$ and $x^2$.
%The two-dimensional metric tensor for the surface is then
%\be
%h_{ab} dx^a dx^b = e^{2(\zetab - \nub)} \rb^2 d\rb^2 + \frac{B^2 e^{-2\nub} \rb^2 \sin^2\theta}{1-v_Z^2} (d\phi - \Omega dt)^2
%\ee
%and hence we get
%\begin{align}\begin{split}
%dS' =& \frac{e^{\zetab}}{B} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v_Z^2}} e^{2\nub} \Bb^2 \rb^2 \sin\theta d\theta (d\phi - \Omega dt) \\
%  =& \frac{e^{\zetab}}{B} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v_Z^2}} dS_o.
%\end{split}\end{align}
%In the limit of \sch space-time $e^{\zetab}/B \approx 1 + \mathcal{O}(\Omega^2)$ and so we obtain a standard result where the latitudinal direction is just Lorentz contracted with $\gamma = (1-v^2)^{-1/2}$ as $v_Z = v + \mathcal{O}(\Omega)$.

\subsection{Angular distribution of radiation}
\subsubsection{Isotropic radiation}

For pulse profile calculations the simplest angular distribution of radiation is given by the Lambert law.  
Here we consider blackbody emission described by the specific intensity
\begin{equation}
  B_{\mathrm{E}}(T) = 5.04 \times 10^{22} \frac{E^3}{\mathrm{exp}(E/T) -1}~\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{keV}^{-1}\,\mathrm{str}^{-1},
\end{equation}
where $T$ and $E$ are given in keV.
Here the radiation is isotropic and hence there is no angle $\mu' = \cos\alpha'$ dependency in our intensity function where $\mu'$ is the cosine of the angle relative to the surface normal as measured by the co-rotating observer.

\subsubsection{Electron scattering dominated atmosphere}

As a second angular distribution we consider the so-called `Hopf profile', which is not isotropic.
We assume that the spectral distribution is still given by the Planck function, but the angular distribution is produced in coherent electron scattering dominated plane-parallel semi-infinite ($\tau \rightarrow \infty$) atmosphere as
\begin{equation}
  I_{\mathrm{E}}(\mu) = B_{\mathrm{E}}(T) \frac{H(\mu)}{2\alpha_1},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \alpha_n = \int_0^1 H(\mu) \mu^n d\mu
\end{equation}
are the moments of the function $H(\mu)$, which is a solution of the Ambartsumian-Chandrasekhar integral equation \citep[see e.g.][]{Cha60,Sob63}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hmu}
  H(\mu) = 1 + \mu H(\mu) \int_0^1 \frac{\Psi(\eta)}{\mu + \eta} H(\eta) d\eta.
\end{equation}
Here $\Psi(\mu)$ is the characteristic function, which depends on the scattering law considered.
For Rayleigh (Thomson) scattering it is
\begin{equation}
  \Psi(\mu) = \frac{3}{16}(3-\mu^2).
\end{equation}
Given $\Psi$, the integral equation \eqref{eq:hmu} can then be iteratively solved, for example, by computing
\begin{align}\begin{split}
&H_{n+1}(\mu) =  \frac{1}{2} H_n(\mu) + \\ &\frac{1}{2}\left( \left[1-2\int_0^1 \Psi(\eta)d\eta \right]^{1/2} + \int_0^1 \frac{\eta \Psi(\eta)}{\mu + \eta} H_n(\eta) d\eta \right)^{-1},
\end{split}\end{align}
with a starting guess of
\begin{equation}\label{eq:apprx_hopf}
  H_0(\mu) = 1 + 2.3\mu - 0.3\mu^2.
\end{equation}
We also note that even the simple polynomial expansion \eqref{eq:apprx_hopf} already has an accuracy better than $<2\%$, and as such it can be used in approximate solutions with corresponding first moment of $\alpha_1 = 1.19167$.


\subsection{Method of solution}

%\includegraphics[width=7cm]{figs/fig6b.pdf}

}
\end{figure}

In practice we trace the photons from the image plate at infinity all
the way to the surface of the star by solving the first order
differential equations \eqref{eq:deltatime} - \eqref{eq:deltaphi}
backwards in time.  In addition, we make a change of variable $r
\rightarrow 1/\tilde{x}$ \red{mikÃ¤ on $\tilde{x}$:n mÃ¤Ã¤ritelmÃ¤?} that will help us by stretching the step when
far from the star and shortening it when coming close to the star
surface.  Here an adaptive stepsize second order Heun's Runge-Kutta
integrator is used with forward Euler's method as
the predictor and trapezoidal method as the corrector.  
All photons that travel
more than $0.95\tilde{x}$ away from the star after a U-turn are
terminated and considered to have missed the star.

Our image plate is defined using a polar coordinate system with a radial
coordinate $b$ (i.e. the impact parameter) and an angular coordinate $\chi$.
We also employ a non-equidistant grid in both coordinates to accommodate
the extra resolution needed around the edges of the star.  Radial
coordinate $b$ is defined using a Gauss-Laguerre abscissae (i.e.
$e^{-b}$-weighted) and the angle coordinate is weighted with a simple
sinusoidal function so that the resolution is increased around the top
and bottom parts where $\chi = 0$ or $\pi$, which is near location of the poles
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:grid}).  By raytracing we then obtain
a mapping between the image plane and the surface of the star, defined
on a grid.
Arbitrary positions in the image plane are 
obtained by a linear interpolation in $(b, \chi)$ space.

For pulse profile calculations where only a small part of the star is
emitting we first search a crude location of the spot on the image plane
and then impose a fine subgrid around it in order to accurately
calculate the flux from this small patch.  The subgrid itself is defined
either in polar grid (by constraining minimum and maximum $\chi$ and
$b$) or in Cartesian image grid (by constraining minimum and maximum
$\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$) depenging on the total area covered.  To
calculate the total flux $F(t)$ we then integrate this small subgrid by
using an adaptive multidimensional integration.  The algorithm is based
on a tensor product of nested Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rules and is
implemented using the \textsc{Cubature} package.

\section{Applications \& Validation}

Next we present some applications of the framework to some simple physical problems related to neutron stars to showcase the possibilities that one can utilize the code to.
The examples are also meant to act as a further validation as we provide comparison of the results, when possible.
Most notably, we employ an extensive comparison against AMP pulse profiles computed with a code that propagates photons forward in time as presented in \citealt{PB06}.
As such, our code serves as a great validation tool for these kind of special relativistic formulations because our framework is fully general relativistic and propagates photons backwards in time from the observer to the surface.



\subsection{Images of neutron stars}

  Right panel shows the image that the observer sees using the Cartesian $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ coordinates.
  For illustrative purposes the neutron star surface is covered with a chess board pattern.
  }
\end{figure*}


As a first application of the code, we can determine the photon trajectories using the ray tracing algorithm and produce an image of the neutron star as seen by the observer.
This also shows how we can connect the Cartesian coordinates $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ of the observer to the coordinates $\phi_e$ and $\theta_e$ of the star.
Left panel in Fig.~\ref{fig:image} shows the trajectory of the photons using also a third $\hat{z}$ dimensions along the Cartesian image plane coordinates.
The star is chosen to have $R=12~\mathrm{km}$ and $M=1.5~\Msun$, whereas the observer is located at the equator with an inclination of $i = 90^{\circ}$.
Here the photons originate from the image plane located at $\hat{z} = 20$ and are then propagated backwards in time until they intersect with the surface of the star (located at $\hat{z} = 0$) , visualized with a spherical see-through wiregrid frame.
Right panel of the figure shows the projected image as seen by a distant observer.
Here the star is covered with a chess board pattern to show the varying $\phi_e$ and $\theta_e$ coordinates.


\subsection{Accuracy of the splitted Hamilton-Jacobi propagator}

\end{figure*}

Next, we study the accuracy of the splitted Hamilton-Jacobi propagator by comparing the results against accurate geodesic solver \textsc{arcmancer}.
The employd comparison solver solves the full second order geodesic equation
\be
\frac{d^2 x^{\mu}}{ds^2} = -\Gamma^{\mu}_{\alpha \beta} \frac{dx^{\alpha}}{ds} \frac{dx^{\beta}}{ds},
\ee
where $s$ is the scalar parameter of the motion e.g. the proper time and $\Gamma^{\mu}_{\alpha \beta}$ are the Christoffel symbols.
Blaablaa...

We also note that for very precise ray tracing problems it is possible to easily switch to using the \textsc{arcmancer} as a photon propagator.

  }
\end{figure}

As a next step, we can study the energy dependent flux from the star by computing the observed energy distribution $E$ for a delta injection of energy $E'$ from the surface.
Because of the varying redshift along the surface of the star, the observer then sees a range of energies in her detector.





\subsection{AMPs pulse profiles}

From here on, we move to time-dependent ray tracing problems by considering pulse profiles from AMPs.
Here some hot spot on top of the suface is emitting and the star is seen to rotate with a frequency of $\Omega$.


%\subsubsection{Schwarzchild $+$ Doppler}

First, a general comparison of the ray tracing algorithm with the so-called Schwarzchild $+$ Doppler approximation \citep[see e.g.][]{PB06} was done.  
For simplicity, only spherical stars were considered here.
Main parameters were: the stellar mass $M = 1.6~\Msun$, the stellar radius $R = 12~\mathrm{km}$, the observer inclination $i = 60^{\circ}$ and the colatitude of the spot $\theta_{\mathrm{d}} = 50^{\circ}$.  
The effective temperature of the radiation was set to $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2~\mathrm{keV}$.  
The distance to the source was assumed to be $D = 10~\mathrm{kpc}$.  
We defined a circular spot with angular radius $\rho$ either $1$ or $30$ degrees, as measured from the center of the neutron star.  
Here we stress that the spot is defined using an angle as measured by the co-rotating observer (see eq.  \eqref{eq:rel_cos}).
Hence, the spot is circular in shape for the co-rotating observer, but not so for the distant static observer.
Angular distribution of radiation either corresponds to Lambert's law, i.e. isotropic blackbody, with constant intensity or an electron scattering dominated atmosphere, i.e. Hopf profile.


The light curves are computed in 128 time bins.  Zero time $t = 0$ corresponds to the moment when the spot center crosses the plane defined by the spin axis and the direction to the observer.  
We computed curves for the five following quantities: monochromatic photon flux ($\mathrm{ph}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{keV}^{-1}$) at the observer energies $E = 2,~6$ and $12~\mathrm{keV}$, bolometric photon flux ($\mathrm{ph}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), and the bolometric energy flux ($\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$).


\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=18cm]{figs/fig2a.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:sch_comp1}
  Light curve comparisons for Schwarzchild spacetime with slowly rotating spherical star ($R = 12~\mathrm{km}$, $M = 1.6~\Msun$, $\nu = 1~\mathrm{Hz}$, $i = 60^{\circ}$, $\theta_s = 50^{\circ}$, $\rho = 1^{\circ}$, and $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2~\mathrm{keV}$) emitting according to Lambert law or Hopf profile with spot size either $1$ or $30$ degrees.
  Black solid line shows the pulse profiles computed using the forward-in-time code by J. Poutanen and red dashed line is a profile computed with the code presented here.
  The lower panel shows the residuals as $\Delta = (\mathrm{model_{JP}}/\mathrm{model} -1) \times 100\%$.
}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=18cm]{figs/fig2b.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:sch_comp400}
  Light curve comparisons for Schwarzchild spacetime with rapidly rotating spherical star ($\nu = 400~\mathrm{Hz}$).
  Otherwise the parameters and symbols are the same is in Fig.~\ref{fig:sch_comp1}.
}
\end{figure*}


Comparison of these lightcurves are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sch_comp1} for slowly rotating star ($1$ Hz) and in Fig.~\ref{fig:sch_comp400} for fast rotation ($400$ Hz).
In practise, comparing the profiles for slow rotation only tests our ray tracing routines because special relativistic effects (Doppler boosting, angle aberration and so on) are negliglible.
Overall agreement of the two different methods is excellent and from here a baseline accuracy of about $<0.2\%$ relative error is constrained for the mapping of quantities between image plane and star's surface.
Similarly, when rotation is increased and special relativistic effects start to play a role we are able to reproduce the pulse profiles usually down to $<0.3\%$ relative error.
No large deviation between isotropic and Hopf profile is detected either, indicating that the emission angle is also computed correctly.

%\subsection{Oblate Schwarzchild $+$ Doppler}

%  Bolometric energy flux comparisons for oblate Schwarzchild approximation with rapidly rotating star ($R_{\mathrm{eq}} = 16.4~\mathrm{km}$, $M = 1.4~\Msun$, $\nu = 600~\mathrm{Hz}$, and $\rho = 1^{\circ}$).

Next we compare emission from oblate surfaces.
The surface here is defined using the radius function \eqref{eq:radf} but the star is still embbed in a symmetric \sch spacetime.
The parameters used are equatorial radius $R_{\mathrm{eq}} = 12~\mathrm{km}$ (in the usual \sch metric), star mass of $M = 1.4~\Msun$, extreme rotational frequency $\nu = 700~\mathrm{Hz}$, observer inclination $i=45^{\circ}$, and spot angular size of $\rho = 10^{\circ}$
Effective temperature of the radiation is again taken to be $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2~\mathrm{keV}$ and the distance $D = 10~\mathrm{kpc}$.
Here the spot size is again defined in the co-rotating \textit{spherical} coordinate system on top of a unit sphere and is then projected to the oblate inclined surface.
To trace the effects of the changing surface we consider the spot in three different locations at colatitudes of $\theta_{\mathrm{S}} = 18^{\circ}$, $45^{\circ}$, and $90^{\circ}$.
Additionally, we consider a spot with emission angle-dependent intensity.
This is done for electron scattering atmosphere with $\theta_{\mathrm{S}} = 45^{\circ}$.
%Additionally for $\theta_{\mathrm{S}} = 90^{\circ}$ when the spot is on the equator we observer a full eclipse in the light curve.
%This imposes a serious test for both of the codes as the gradually more and more blocked spot is also seen from a very shallow angle before disappearing and appearing again.
%We note that when integrating flux from the spot in the image plane, a polar subgrid is extremely useful just before the eclipse as the impact parameter can vary only by a $\sim1\%$ before the spot is hidden behind the star.
%Attaining a similar resolution in a Cartesian subgrid would then need far more integrand evaluations as the spot is seen from a very shallow angle.

Comparison of the oblate lightcurves are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:osch_comp700}.
Again we obtain excellent agreement against the forward-in-time method with similar errors as in the spherical case (relative error $< 0.2\%$).
This agreement is, of course, expected since our method is general and does not depend on the shape of the emitting surface.

\section{Additional stuff about elliptic integrals and so on}

After separating the equation \eqref{eq:hamjac} with the help of the Carter's constant $\Ca$, we get the remaining four-momentum components
\be\label{eq:pr}
p_r = \pd_r S = e^{-2\nub} \left( (E-L_z \omega)^2 - \frac{\mathcal{C}}{e^{-2\nub} r^2} \right)^{1/2} = \mathcal{R}(r)
\ee
and
\be\label{eq:ptheta}
p_{\theta} = \pd_{\theta} S = e^{\mu} \left( \mathcal{C} - \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2 \theta} \right)^{1/2} = \Theta(\theta).
\ee
Now, in addition to our pre-defined constants $E$ and $L_z$, we have a new constant of motion $\Ca$, for which
\be
\frac{\pd S}{\pd \mathcal{C}} = \frac{1}{2} \int^r \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mathcal{R}}} \frac{\pd \mathcal{R}}{\pd \mathcal{C}} dr + \frac{1}{2} \int^{\theta} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Theta}} \frac{\pd \Theta}{\pd \mathcal{C}} d\theta = 0.
\ee 
After substitution and cancellation of terms the relation leads to elliptic integrals of the form
\begin{align}\begin{split}\label{eq:Lz_C_rel}
 \int^r dr e^{\nub} & r^{-2} \left( (E-L_z\omega)^2 - \frac{\mathcal{C}}{e^{-2\nub} r^2} \right)^{-3/4}  = \\
& \int^{\theta} d\theta e^{\mu/2} \left(\mathcal{C} - \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2 \theta} \right)^{-3/4}
\end{split}\end{align}
connecting our three constants of motion.
This can be refined further when we remember that $e^{\mu} \approx 1$, i.e. constant without any $\theta$ dependency. 
With this in mind, we can write
\be
\int^{\theta} d\theta e^{\mu/2} \left(\mathcal{C} - \frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2
\theta} \right)^{-3/4} = -\frac{e^{\mu/2} L_z}{\mathcal{C} (\mathcal{C}-L_z^2)^{1/4}} [ \Pi(n; \alpha, -1)+\Pi(-n;\alpha, -1)],
\ee
where $\Pi$ is the incomplete elliptic integral of the third kind with parameters $n = \sqrt{1-L_z^2/\mathcal{C}}$ as the elliptic charasteristic and the angle $\alpha$ defined as $\sin^4 \alpha = (\mathcal{C}-L_z^2 \csc^2 \theta)/(\mathcal{C}-L_z^2))$ with elliptic modulus of $-1$.

\section{Special case: equatorial rays}
If we limit ourselves to the equatorial plane ($\theta=\pi/2$ reflection symmetry) the bending equations are simplified tremendously due to the loss of four-momentum component along the $\hat{\theta}$ direction.
The general coordinates of a photon are defined as $x^{\alpha} = (x^{t}, x^{r}, x^{\theta}, x^{\phi})$ and the four-velocity is obtained from $dx^{\alpha}/d\lambda$ through affine parameter $\lambda$.
Again, due to the two Killing vectors $t^{\alpha}$ and $\phi^{\alpha}$ we now set our constants directly to $u_{t} = 1$ and $u_{\phi} = b$, where $b$ is an impact parameter defined more thoroughly later on.
In the equatorial plane a dual of the four-velocity is then $u_{\alpha} = (1, u_{r}, 0, b)$.
Finally, from $x^{\alpha}x_{\alpha} = 0$ we can solve the $u_{r}$ component to be
\be
u_{r} = e^{-2\nub}\sqrt{(1-b\omega)^2 - e^{2\nub}\frac{b^2}{r^2}} 
\ee

The emission angle $\alpha$ is easily obtained by using the vector notation
\be
\tan \alpha = \frac{(u^{\phi}u_{\phi})^{1/2}}{(u^ru_r)^{1/2}}
\ee
yielding
\begin{align}\begin{split}
\cos \alpha = & 1 + (e^{-2\nub}r^2\omega^2 -1) \times \\
            & \left( 1+b\omega - \sqrt{(1+b\omega)^2 - \left(\frac{b}{e^{-\nub}r}\right)^2} \right),
\end{split}\end{align}
which reduced to 
\be
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1-\left( \frac{b}{e^{-\nub_0}r} \right)^2},
\ee
in the limit of no rotation $\omega \rightarrow 0$. This corresponds to the solution in a \sch space-time when we remember that $e^{\nub_0} = (1-\rg/R)$.
